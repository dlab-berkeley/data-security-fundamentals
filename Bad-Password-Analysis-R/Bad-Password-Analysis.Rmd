#### What makes a good password?

To answer that question, we examine a dataset of *bad* passwords sourced from data breaches by the people at [Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/top-500-passwords-visualized/?utm_content=buffer994fa&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer). We explore the features of these passwords, create and visualize a multivariate regression model to determine which of these password features are most protective from being cracked by malicious alorithms. 

```{r}

# import dataset from URL link
passwords <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-14/passwords.csv', 
            # restructure variables as factors
              col_types = cols(category = col_factor(),
                               time_unit = col_factor())) %>% 
             # purge NA values.
              na.omit()

# evaluate structure of dataset. 
glimpse(passwords)

```

There are a few variables of interest in this dataset we use in this workflow: 

* `category` describes the "genre" a password draws from. 
* `strength` is a numerical measurement of password's resiliency to being hacked.
* `password` is the password itself, which we will extract categorical features from to inform our regression model.

```{r}

# group and count by password category 
 passwords %>% 
  group_by(category) %>% 
  count() %>% 
# plot.
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(category, n), y = n, fill = category)) +
  geom_col(alpha = .8, width = .5) +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Password Subject Matter Types Among Bad Passwords") +
  xlab("Category") +
  ylab("Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "NULL") 


```

> We see that many bad passwords include some aspect of the user's name, followed by `cool-macho` and `simple-alphanumeric` entries. 


```{r}

passwords %>% 
  group_by(category) %>% 
  summarise(avg_strength = round(mean(strength))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(category, avg_strength), y = avg_strength, 
             fill = category)) +
    geom_col(alpha = .7, width = .5) +
  coord_flip() +
   ggtitle("Password Strength Scores Among Bad Passwords") +
  xlab("Category") +
  ylab("Strength Score") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "NULL") 


```

> Looking at an averaged Strength Score of these bad passwords, `nerdy-pop` genres appear strongest and passwords referencing `food` lack the most strength overall.  

In the next chunk we create categorical features based upon the content of the `password` values. Which passwords contain only numbers? Only letters? Does a password repeat stuff? What are the differences in length of password, how many characters the password is composed of?  These are the questions our newly transformed features variables can answer. 

```{r}


## create features from the passwords variable
passwords_with_features <- passwords %>% mutate(
  # does password contain only numbers?
  all_num = ifelse(str_detect(password, "^[0-9]*$"), 1, 0),
  # does password contain only letters?
  all_let = ifelse(str_detect(password, "^[a-zA-Z]*$"), 1, 0),
  # does password contain repeated strings?
  rep_str = ifelse(str_detect(password, "\\b(\\S+?)\\1\\S*\\b"), 1, 0),
  # length of password
  pw_len = str_length(password),
  # combined flags in categorical variable
  pw_feat = paste0(
    ifelse(all_num == 1, "All numbers, ", ""),
    ifelse(all_let == 1, "All letters, ", ""),
    ifelse(all_num == 0 & all_let == 0, "Mixed numbers and letters, ", ""),
    ifelse(rep_str == 1, "repeated strings.", "no repeated strings."))) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(password))


# summary of password features.
passwords_with_features %>% 
  group_by(pw_feat) %>% 
  summarize(pw_feature_count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(pw_feature_count)
```

Everyday experience would suggest that password length: how many characters a password is composed of would be a protective element. Is that true? Let's start looking at the relationship between our continous `pw_length` variable and the logged `strength` score.

```{r}

## vizualize relationship between pw_length and strength.
passwords_with_features %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(alpha = .5,
    aes(x = jitter(pw_len, 2), 
        y = jitter(log(strength + 1), 2), 
        col = pw_feat)) +
  xlab("Password Length (+ jitter)") +
  ylab("Logged Password Strength Score (+ jitter)") +
  labs(col = "Password Features") +
  ggtitle("Length and Features of Bad Passwords.") +
  theme_minimal()


```

Up at the top of this graph we see how stronger passwords have a mixture of letters and numbers. It also looks like letter-only passwords become stronger as more characters are used to create them. 


#### Correlations between `pw_length` and `strength` variables:


```{r, message = F}

# Positive correlation between length and strength with all letter passwords
passwords_with_features %>% 
  filter(str_detect(pw_feat, "All letters,")) %>% 
  select(pw_len, strength) %>% 
  correlate() %>% fashion()

# Positive correlation between strength and no repeated strings
passwords_with_features %>% 
  filter(pw_feat == "All letters, no repeated strings."|
         pw_feat == "All numbers, no repeated strings.") %>% 
  select(pw_len, strength) %>% 
  correlate() %>% fashion()

# Negative correlation between strength and length with repeated strings
passwords_with_features %>% 
  filter(pw_feat == "All numbers, repeated strings." |
         pw_feat == "All letters, repeated strings.") %>% 
  select(pw_len, strength) %>% 
  correlate() %>% fashion()


```

There are some strong linear relationships between letter only passwords and length.  With these initial explorations in the pocket, we  come up with the following hypotheses to test with a few questions we may ask a regression model:

* Will passwords that contain only numbers *or* only letters be less strong than passwords which contain a mixture of both letters *and* numbers?

* Will passwords with repeated strings be less strong than passwords without repetition in them?

* Is the effect of password length stronger for passwords that use only letters? 

Let's put the model together and see what happens.. 


```{r}

## Linear regression model with password features variables
pw_model <- lm(data = passwords_with_features,
  # log transform strength and add 1 so constant does not refer to zero.
  formula = log(strength + 1) ~ 
    all_num + all_let * scale(pw_len, scale = FALSE) + rep_str)

# summary output.
summary(pw_model)

```

> Our model looks fairly strong: median residuals are fairly low, and almost all of our coefficients return with a statistically significant p-value. 


```{r}

## Plot model outputs for visualization
passwords_with_features %>% ggplot(
  aes(x = jitter(pw_len - mean(pw_len), 2), 
      y = jitter(log(strength + 1), 2), 
  col = pw_feat)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  # regression line for numbers and letters together
  geom_abline(intercept = 3.58165, slope = -0.02250, 
              alpha = .7, 
              color = 'red',
              size = 1) + 
  # regression line for all letters, no repeated strings
  geom_abline(intercept = 3.58165 + -1.52068, 
              slope = -0.02250 + 0.13932, 
              alpha = .7,
              color = 'blue',
              size = 1) + 
  xlab("Password Length (plus jitter) mean centred") +
  ylab("Logged Password Strength Score (plus jitter)") +
  xlim(c(-3, 8)) + 
  labs(col = "Features of password") +
  ggtitle("Strength of password by password length and features among Bad Passwords.") +
  theme_minimal()

```

From looking at these distributions and our fitted lines we may come to a few conclusions: 

* "Stronger passwords have a mixture of letters and numbers, but the length is not a feature that makes these type of passwords stronger. It may even impede their strength."

* "Letter-only passwords become stronger when they're longer, when more characters are used." 


>The results we got support what this XKCD comic has to say about the number theory behind password strength. Really good data security advice!
